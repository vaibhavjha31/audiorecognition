# audiorecognition
The following research paper depicts about a ML model that identifies an audio already existing somewhere in the database using LSD HASH function and the following is then verified by spectograms of the user input audio and one from database.


Working:
The fingerprints of the audio files are generated and then matched with the user input one, if a match is found i.e the fingerprints are same (this can be verified by overlapping spectograms) then it can be said that the 2 files are same.
